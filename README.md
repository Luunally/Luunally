- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Luunally but you can call me Y :)
      I'm a linguist, translator, and interpreter, specialized in intercultural communication.
      I'm currently learning ruby, as well as the basics in software engineering.
      Feel free to contact me through luunally@gmail.com (or whichever other way you might find).
